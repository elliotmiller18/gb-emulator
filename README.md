This is a GameBoy emulator with CPU simulation (clock and interrupts atm.) Later on, we will implement sub-instruction timing, hyper-accurately simulating the internal divider circuit and its hardware bugs, and maybe if I hit the startup lottery, retire early, and do side projects full time, JIT compilation. 

Roadmap:

1. Graphics (openGL)
2. Audio (macOS only)
3. Sub-instruction timing
4. Hyper-accurate internal divider circuit simulation (including hardware bugs)
5. Linux support
6. Windows support
