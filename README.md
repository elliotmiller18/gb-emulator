This is a GameBoy emulator with CPU simulation (clock and interrupts atm.) Later on, we will implement sub-instruction timing, hyper-accurately simulating the internal divider circuit and its hardware bugs, and maybe if I hit the startup lottery, retire early, and do side projects full time, JIT compilation. 

Roadmap:

- Finish interrupts
- Input
- Proper memory banking
- Graphics (openGL)
- Audio (macOS only)
- Sub-instruction timing
- ~~Hyper-accurate internal divider circuit simulation~~ this was actually very easy
- (including hardware bugs) this part will not be as easy ...
- Linux support
- Windows support
