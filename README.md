This is a GameBoy emulator with accurate CPU simulation. Later on, we will implement sub-instruction timing, ~~hyper-accurately simulating the internal divider circuit and its hardware bugs~~, and maybe if I hit the startup lottery, retire early, and do side projects full time, JIT compilation. 

Roadmap:

- ~~Finish interrupts~~
- ~~Input~~
- Proper memory banking
- Graphics (openGL)
- Audio (macOS only)
- Sub-instruction timing
- ~~Hyper-accurate internal divider circuit simulation~~ 
- Hardware bugs
